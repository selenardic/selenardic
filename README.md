# Hi, I’m Selen 👋  

**Aspiring Product Manager & Young Professional | King's Alumna | London | Building MVPs and learning in public**  

### Currently learning
- Product Management (Career Accelerator @ King’s College London)  
- Building MVPs using GitHub, Codespaces, and AI tools  
- Turning user problems into simple, working solutions  

### Projects I’m working on
- 🏠 **Homeshare MVP** → Connecting elderly people with spare rooms to students needing affordable housing in the UK (focus: trust + accessibility)  
- 👩‍💼 **Coaching App MVP** → Career confidence + personal branding for young professionals (focus: subscription model & UX flow)  
- 🤝 **Common Ground (Friendship App)** → A social experiment to connect people based on current challenges and shared values, designed to spark meaningful friendships (think “formal BFFs” but better — matching through lived experiences)  
- 📊 **Mini Data Project** → Exploring datasets to create product insights & metrics  

### What you’ll find in my repos
- Clear **README docs** with problem, solution, and KPIs  
- **PRDs, user stories, and roadmaps** for each project  
- A mix of lightweight code + product artefacts  
- Reflections on what I’d improve in the next version  

### ⚡ Why this matters
I'm showcasing my creativity and how I’d work with engineers, designers, and stakeholders by using GitHub the way real teams do:  
- Writing user stories + acceptance criteria  
- Using Issues, Pull Requests, and Projects for scope management  
- Shipping small and soft, iterating fast, and measuring impact
